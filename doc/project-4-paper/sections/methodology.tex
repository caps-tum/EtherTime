\subsection{Testbed -- Hardware and Software}

To conduct our evaluation we employ a total of four hardware testbeds. These include a cluster consisting of three Raspberry Pi 4 attached to an isolated wired Ethernet network via a single Gigabit Ethernet switch and a second cluster consisting of three Raspberry Pi 5 in the same hardware layout. There are two key differences relevant to timekeeping between the Raspberry-Pi 4 and the Raspberry-Pi 5: The Raspberry-Pi 5 has support for PTP hardware timestamping on the network interface, and it has an integrated real-time clock (RTC) that can be powered by an external battery, both of which the Raspberry-Pi 4 lacks~\cite{raspberry-pi-datasheets}. Furthermore, we utilize a cluster of four Xilinx ZUBoard 1CGs, which feature a combination of ARM Cortex A53 and ARM Cortex R5F cores. These boards were adapted to run Debian with the standard Xilinx Kernel for access to the larger package repository. The kernel was also patched for R8152/R8153 support for our secondary Ethernet adapters\todo{Work on descriptions}. This selection of hardware is representative of the range of embedded systems/edge devices available, which may or may not include these hardware features that we expect to provide benefits to the synchronization quality. All clusters are controlled by programmable power delivery units so that we can simulate hardware failures in each component individually.
