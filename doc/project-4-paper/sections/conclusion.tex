Lessons learned:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Don't use PTP:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Convergence order of magnitude slower
        \item Faults can bring down entire network interface
    \end{itemize}
    \item Prefer physical isolation, prioritization needs to be considered carefully
    \item Prefer real-time clock (at least on master)
\end{itemize}
